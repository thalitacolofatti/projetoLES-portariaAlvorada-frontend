This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) for the Software Engineering Lab class of Fatec SP.
The project consists of a consultation and registration system for those responsible for students who can take them of school. After registering the person responsible, it is possible to link them to one or more students. This link can also be deleted if necessary. It still needs adjustments to be complete.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the result.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
